# Thoracoscopic Training VR

## Overview
This project presents an innovative Virtual Reality (VR) simulation platform designed for thoracoscopic surgery training. Utilizing advanced soft-body simulation techniques, particularly Extended Position-Based Dynamics (XPBD), this platform offers a cost-effective and accessible solution for training thoracic surgery residents in Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) techniques.

## Key Features
- **Realistic Soft-Body Simulation**: Implements XPBD to accurately model the behavior of lung tissue during surgical procedures.
- **VR Integration**: Developed for Meta Quest 2, providing an immersive training experience.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Offers immediate visual and haptic feedback for realistic surgical tool-tissue interactions.
- **Customizable Training Scenarios**: Includes various exercises designed to progressively enhance soft-body manipulation skills.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Incorporates a comprehensive system for assessing and providing feedback on trainee performance.

## Technical Details
- **Simulation Framework**: Uses a particle-based system with constraints to model deformable objects.
- **Mesh Generation**: Employs tetrahedral meshes refined using Delaunay techniques for volume preservation.
- **Unity Integration**: Seamlessly integrates the simulation into the Unity environment for real-time execution.
- **Data Collection**: Records simulation data in CSV format for detailed analysis and validation.

##  Experimental Results
The platform was evaluated in collaboration with thoracic surgery residents at the University of Turin. The study demonstrated:
- Improved performance across tasks of varying complexity.
- Positive feedback on the system's usability, realism, and educational value.
- Potential for enhancing surgical skills in a risk-free environment.

##  Future Directions
- Refinement of the computational model to include more complex tissue behaviors (e.g., tearing, cutting).
- Expansion of training scenarios to cover a wider range of surgical techniques.
- Extension to other types of surgeries, such as abdominal procedures.
- Longitudinal studies to compare VR training effectiveness with traditional methods.
